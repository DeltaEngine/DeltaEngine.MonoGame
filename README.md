Delta Engine
============

The Delta Engine is allows you to develop applications and especially games for many different platforms (mobile, tablets, console, PC) completely under Windows with .NET by using your favorite tools. This is the Milestone 1: Pluto release (v0.9.6) and it focuses on Windows 8 and Windows Phone support.

It is free to use on Windows, Open Source and written in C# (.NET). Supported Frameworks: DirectX, OpenGL and XNA. There is also a native C++ version available at https://github.com/DeltaEngine/DeltaEngineCpp

This release uses nuget to get all required dependencies (you can also get the Delta Engine itself via nuget). We also recommend Visual Studio 2012 (e.g. the Express version). For additional tips see: http://DeltaEngine.net/Start/Cs

Please note that the current release is a very early preview of our new engine and not much useful code or classes have been ported! For details see http://DeltaEngine.net
